AddressBookCocoa
This sample demonstrates how to create, access, add, search, and retrieve records using Address Book's Objective-C APIs. It defines and implements the addContact and findContact methods to perform these tasks. The addContact method creates a person named Elba, sets its first and last name, address, and phone number information, and adds him to the Address Book. The findContact method looks for Elba in Address Book using ABPersonâ€™s searchElementForProperty:label:key:value:comparison: API and fetches his first name, street address, and work fax number.
