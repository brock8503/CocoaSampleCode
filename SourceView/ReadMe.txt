SourceView
==========

"SourceView" is a Cocoa sample application that demonstrates how to use NSOutlineView driven by NSTreeController and various other Cocoa classes to produce a Finder-like source view.

Among the features demonstrated are -

- Source outline view using NSOutlineView using a custom outline cell ImageAndTextCell,
- Loading dictionary data from disk using [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFileâ€¦] to populate the outline view,
- Outline view uses selection highlight style: NSTableViewSelectionHighlightStyleSourceList, which gives is a gradient-style selection.
- Icon view of directories using NSCollectionView,
- Viewing URLs using WebView,
- Outline view drag and drop support for URLs and file system-based objects (from Safari, Finder, etc),
- Factoring or organizing its various NSViews into a separate nib using NSViewController,
- Factoring or organizing its various Windows into a separate nib using NSWindowController,
- Obtaining file system icons using NSWorkspace,
- NSplitView sub-pane size management during divider resize,
- Using template images in our buttons such as NSImageNameAddTemplate and NSImageNameRemoveTemplate,
- NSWindow edge alteration using [NSWindow setContentBorderThickness]

Note:
This sample has been upgraded to support "sandboxing".
Some of the changes worth noting are:
    1) All access to specific file system-based locations outside of the app's sandbox have been removed.
    2) for the WebView to allow targeting URLs, the entitlement "com.apple.security.network.client" is turned on (or "Allow Outgoing Connections")

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:

OS X 10.6.x or later

USING THE SAMPLE:

Simply build and run the sample using Xcode, launch SourceView and examine the contents in the outline view.
The first section "Devices" is automatically added with the help of: [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] mountedLocalVolumePaths]. The second section "Places" is also automatically added by the window controller.

The sections following are determined by the external Outline.dict file, read in as a NSDictionary and populated into the NSOutlineView.  You can experiment on your own with adding and removing items in this file.
