### Sketch+Accessibility ###

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This sample builds on the Sketch sample application to demonstrate a number of accessibility techniques including:
* Use of an AccessibilityImageDescriptions.strings file
* Overriding attributes programmatically and in Interface Builder
* Creating a subclass to return a custom value description.
In addition, the example also demonstrates making a more complex custom view, the graphic view of Sketch, accessible using the layout area suite of roles and attributes introduced in Snow Leopard.
